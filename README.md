# Face Mask Detection in Python using PyTorch

This repo presents an implementation of Deep Learning approach for Detecting Faces With and Without mask. 


- **Face Mask Detection Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset 

Data set consists of 7553 RGB images in 2 folders as with_mask and without_mask. Images are named as label with_mask and without_mask. Images of faces with mask are 3725 and images of faces without mask are 3828.

As we can see the trained model achieved successful performance in classifying faces based on the presence or absence of a mask.
